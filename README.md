# Bacterial Cellulose-coated Scaffold
Exploring innovative materials for personal biofabrication in the medical sector

# Tutorial
Here's a tutorial on How to make a Bacterial Cellulose-coated Scaffold.
We've chosen Yamanaka medium for this tutorial because it gives good results, but the "Growth Mediums" file on this repository lists the ingredients needed to grow Yamanaka, Hestrin-Schramm and Zhou cultures.

# 1. Softwares, Tools & Ingredients:

- Rhinoceros 7
- Preform

- Formlabs Printer (Form3L & Form2 have been used in this experimentation) with Resin Tank and Build Platform
- ["Formlabs Clear Resin 1L"](https://formlabs.com/fr/boutique/clear-resin-1l/)
- ["Formlabs Form Wash"](https://formlabs.com/fr/boutique/post-processing/form-wash/)
- ["Formlabs Form Cure"](https://formlabs.com/fr/boutique/post-processing/form-cure/)
- Scale
- Autoclave
- Beakers
- Spoons 
- Alcohol
- Parafilm
- Spatula

- Distilled water: 50cl
- Glucose: 25g
- Yeast extract: 2.5g
- Ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4: 2.5g
- Potassium sulfate KH2PO4: 1.5g
- Magnesium sulfate: MgSO47H2O: 0.025g
- Bacterial cellulose mother strain: 10% (v/v)
All the chemical dry ingredients have been ordered from Labbox and are from Labkem brand

# 2. How to get the right conditions:

In order to obtain the **best conditions** to optimize the rendering of the gelatin sheet, it is necessary to asepticize as much as possible the instruments and the supports used during the recipe. It is therefore important to **wash your hands, put gloves, clean the tools with alcohol and be in a place where the air circulates well.**

# 3. Procedure for creating 50cl of Yamanaka Medium:

- Use weights to weight ingredients
- In the first bottle, mix half volume water with glucose
- In the second bottle, mix half volume water with the rest of dry ingredients
- Autoclave both bottles at 121°C for 20min
- Store glucose solution and Yamanaka separately
- Mix half:half to use as a complete Yamanaka medium
- Store in room temperature
  
# 4.Scaffold modeling and printing:

- Open Rhinoceros 7 and Grasshopper.
- Download the Intralattice and Dendro libraries from the Food4Rhino website.
- Use these libraries and adjust the desired parameters to model the scaffold you want. Watch the video ["How to design a 3D Scaffold for Bioprinting with Rhinoceros + Meshmixer software"](https://youtu.be/8fmDWN_ClcY?feature=shared)
- Save your scaffold in .stl format
- Download Preform printing software
- Connect to your Formlabs printer
- Open your scaffold model in .stl and generate supports
- Start printing

- When printing is complete, put on gloves to avoid touching the toxic resin, and remove your scaffold from the tray with a spatula.
- Place your scaffolds in the isopropyl alcohol wash tank and run the wash for 50min.
- Then place your scaffolds in the polymerization solution for 15min.
- Pick up your scaffolds, place them in as sterile a place as possible, and remove the supports with clean hands.

# 5. Culture preparation for scaffolds:

- Put each of your scaffolds in different beakers and pour a little of your Y medium into each of your beakers, about half the height of your scaffolds.
- Cover the beakers with parafilm which lets oxygen through but keeps the preparation safe from contamination.
- Place your beakers in an incubator that maintains a fixed environment: a temperature of around 30°C and CO2 at around 5%.
- Wait 10 days for the culture to settle in.
- On day 10, remove your scaffolds from the cultures.
- Using the bacterial cellulose film formed in the cultures, place them at the bottom of a beaker, then place your scaffold on top and cover the beaker.
- On day 13, remove the bacterial cellulose films and measure and weigh the percentage of BC colonization of the scaffolds.
